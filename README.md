# Iris Flower Dataset

This repository contains the Iris dataset, which consists 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project performed in Jupyter Notebook using python language. This repo consists of DecisionTreeClassifier models to perform classification on the iris dataset.
